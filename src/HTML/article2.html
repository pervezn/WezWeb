                    Islam is a unique religion where although the teachings are fairly consistent, the practice of it can differ depending on what culture you live in. Culture, for better or worse, influences your practice of Islam. Dr. Umar Faruq Abd-Allah describes Islam as being a clear river and culture being the bedding of the river. Ultimately, the river will take on the color of the bedding underneath it. It doesn’t change the fact the river is still a river, but it just looks a little different.

                    Growing up, I had a difficult time reconciling my parents' Pakistani culture with my American upbringing. Given that Pakistan is a predominantly Muslim country, there was never a need to explicitly define what being “Muslim” means there. The environment my parents grew up in greatly differed from what my brothers and I experienced growing up in the United States. It’s what my parents knew, so that’s how they raised us. The Islam I was being brought up with had influence from a culture that I never got to live out or understand internally, so I often clashed with my parents because our ways of thinking were different. This culture clash caused a rift between myself and Pakistani culture and for a long time, I rejected it. That is until I understood that my parents’ culture wasn’t meant to perfectly intertwine with my life as a Muslim in America. However, living in America, where Muslims are not the majority and Pakistani-Muslim culture is not the only “Muslim” culture, how do we create Muslim-American culture? Does one already exist? And finally, who creates Muslim-American culture?

                    The word “culture” itself is very complicated. This is namely, as Raymon Williams says in his book Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society, because the word is used in many different intellectual realms and in several distinct yet incompatible systems of thought. In its early uses, culture was a ‘noun of process.’ Essentially, it was used to describe taking care of plants/crops or livestock. The word since then has transformed multiple times, but Williams categorizes culture’s modern use into three categories. The first is describing culture as a process of spiritual, intellectual, and aesthetic development. Another category describes culture as “a particular way of life, whether of a people, a period, a group, or humanity in general”. Finally, the most widespread use of culture follows the category of “works and practices of intellectual and especially artistic activity” i.e. music, literature, painting, film, etc. Using this as the framework of understanding culture, who defines Muslim-American culture? Is there even an established Muslim-American culture to define?

                    Right now, I don’t think there is. Culture entails similar experiences based on shared identity. There are elements of a culture being established in Muslim America—for example, conferences such as the Islamic Society of North America and the Islamic Circle of North America, and halal food festivals—but these do not necessarily appeal to the majority of Muslims in America.

                    As William suggests, the most widespread use of culture refers to the arts, i.e. music, literature, painting, film, etc. Does this mean our culture-drivers are people that belong to these realms? I think defining a Muslim-American culture is going to be one of the most difficult challenges my generation and the ones to come will face. Our first task is to combat the negative misconceptions about Islam and Muslim identity. Right now, most negative rhetoric comes from media outlets and film industries. Both fields tend to depict Muslims and their cultures as villainous. To do this, it’s helpful to have celebrities/well-known faces in the media to represent Muslims, such as Hasan Minhaj (comedian), Yuna (musician), Ibtihaj Muhammed (Olympic athlete), or Ilhan Omar (politician). Although Muslims continue to contribute to the overarching American culture, we do not have a culture of our own due to a lack of institutional support for Muslims in various industries.

                    Institutions are large entities that have the backing, financially and physically, to support individuals and make an impact. For example, in America, we have a growing force of Muslim journalists, such as Noor Tagouri and Wajahat Ali, but we do not have a well-known newspaper that the mass majority of Muslims in America read for news. We have Muslims in the music industry, but we do not have Muslim music labels or people in higher positions to provide support to current or new artists. In politics, we lack a platform to push for any substantial change at legal levels, forcing us to remain guests in our home country. Instead, we are continuously being othered through policies like Trump’s Muslim Ban. A Muslim-American identity cannot form until we have large bodies that can support and leverage individuals looking to make a change. These institutions will help us create a secure footing, then through these institutions, we start formulating a Muslim identity.

                    Even in the realm of creating institutions, we, as Muslims, are making progress. Take the Pillars Fund for example. This organization formed in 2010 and uses money given by donors to fund new projects and initiatives created by Muslims. Through institutions like the Pillars Fund and the programs it supports, we can start creating, and once we start creating, we will develop a voice. This voice is critical, especially since we live as minorities in an Islamaphobic world.

                    Ultimately, the formation of our Muslim-American culture starts with us: the Muslim-Americans. I believe culture starts from the bottom of the social hierarchy and moves up. The masses have the ability to change the current ebb and flow. A celebrity can endorse a product or start a trend, but if the masses don’t follow up on it, then it doesn’t have momentum and ultimately fizzles out. Right now, Muslim-American culture is malleable and it’s up to us to decide what we want it to look like.
